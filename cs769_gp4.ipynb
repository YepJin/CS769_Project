            "A) Essentially, the equity principle states that channel members should be compensated based on the value they provide to the value chain. They should be compensated fairly for the costs they have and/or value they create.   B) Manufacturers typically provide a great deal of the value add in the value chain, but because of their lack of ability to set final prices, may not always receive their fair share of the margins and profits.   C) A channel functional analysis framework/thought process can be mutually beneficial and help facilitate greater equity because it brings the channel members together and helps bring some definition to what can be a murky process. Without doing this, each channel member is out to maximize their own profits. If channel can be brought together, profits can be maximized for the whole channel. It involves defining the channel, defining everyone's functions and costs within the channel system, and estimating share/allocation of the value created based on who is doing what work. \n",
            "Push channel strategies are sales tactics that consumers/customers can usually identify very easily. These trade promotions catch their eye and clearly indicated to them the manufacturers, wholesalers, and/or retailers are trying to sell them a product, or \"push\" the product onto them. These sort of tactics are required to compete in highly completive industries where consumers are not extremely brand loyal. These promotions help push or incentivize consumers/customers to make a purchase, but they do not come cheap. Many if not all of these promotions reduce margins per unit or add other costs.      Some examples of these for end consumers are in-store/online promotions, displays, contests and/or incentives. End consumer promotions try to persuade consumers to pick this product versus another.    Some examples of these for trade customers training programs, trade shows, etc. Trade promotions persuade as well, but sometimes use other tactics such as providing value (such as training) to retailers. \n",
            "A) I view this conflict as vertical conflict because it is between the manufacturer and their retail partners as well as goal conflict. The manufacturer's goal is to expand their distribution while the retailers want the exact opposite.   B) The manufacturer could create exclusive products/services for their existing retailer network. This would allow them to expand their more broad product line to other retailers but still provide their core retailer network with some exclusivity. \n",
            "Gray markets are extremely important to some manufacturers especially to those in luxury industries that have high margins and rely on high product prices and scarcity to create a sense of exclusivity.      Some gray markets allow consumers to purchase high-end products at reduced prices. While this may be good for those consumers, it is very bad for the luxury brands. As mentioned above, these brands rely on consumers' price/quality heuristic (sense of if something is expensive, it is of high quality). If consumers start to see their products cheaper on secondary markets, their perception of the brand and their willingness to pay will begin to erode. If this happens enough, the overall image of the brand and their products will change. This should be a major concern for brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, etc. \n",
            "A) This concept is stating that brand manager should be concerned with the following two things:   Coordinated - this means that price will be attractive enough to end-users, while adhering to the brand strategy, to make the purchase, profitable for the company, and allows enough margin for the channel members.   Efficient - this means the price must also not only cover the costs of the product but also all benefits included in the channel in which it is purchased.   B) Ownership transfer can create pricing challenges for manufacturers because it takes away their ability to set the final price for the consumers. Once they have sold their product to a wholesaler or retailer, they don't have any more control over the price presented to the next member of the value chain. For example, I worked on the Ziploc brand and SC Johnson last summer. Once we sell our to a wholesaler and/or directly to Walmart, we no longer get to dictate the price they will be resold for.   C) We request retailers stock our products without actually selling them to the retailer, at the time of purchase the retailer would be able to collect a percentage of the sale (potentially with some stocking fees as well). \n"

            "A. The equity principle is the idea that all partners/parties within a channel should be compensated based on how much work they put in/how much the are spending on a specific function, i.e., each channel partner should be paid what they are worth.   B. The manufacturer should care about the equity principal because understand how much work each partner in a channel is putting in can help a manufacturer know who to value/compensate more because the work they are doing is extremely important and valuable, which channel is falling short and needs to be updated/improved, and potential other solutions for making the entire channel strategy better.   C. Using channel functional analysis framework can facilitate greater equity in the channel because it helps a manufacturer outline each function a member of the channel performs, how much of said function they are performing, and how much cost is associated with that function. This framework visually lays out how much time, effort, and money each channel member is giving and can help manufactures communicate better with their partners on how to improve issues. It can also help manufactures explain why a certain retailer or wholesalers might be seeing different compensation etc. This framework is really a means to foster positive communication when partnerships are difficult. \n",
            "Push promotional strategies are often a substantial portion of a manufactures sales and marketing budget because this type of marketing strategies centers around getting channel partners, like retailers and wholesalers, to “push” the manufactures product on to consumers and end-users. This requires manufactures to provide most, if not all, of the budget to its partners for promotional displays, sales teams, coupons, space one shelf etc. to get their product to the public. An example of a push marketing strategy would be an end cap display at Hy-Vee for a new cereal being made by General Mills. General Mills knows that not many people are going to know about their new cereal, and they know their partners will be hesitant to put it on shelves as it may not sell well. So, to try and sell their product General Mills will give money to Hy-Vee for them to put up a promotional end cap display in an effort to push the product into the minds of consumers shopping at the store and get them to buy it. General Mills will be using this end-cap/promotional strategy at grocery stores across the country resulting in a large marking expenditure. \n",
            "A. They type of conflict we are seeing in the above scenario is goal conflict. Goal conflict occurs when the goals of two or more channel members are incompatible. For example, in this scenario the manufacture’s goal is to intensify distribution meaning more product in more locations however the existing dealers are worried about completion and losing market share. Intensify distribution would likely make competition worse showing that these goals conflict with each other.   B. One approach the manufacturer could take to minimize this conflict/improve alignment is to offer exclusive product lines to their existing dealer network. In doing this, the existing dealers would have unique product offerings and consumers would be forced to shop at they existing dealers establishments to get the product they need. This would minimize both competition and loss of market share because the SKUs would be different across the retailer network. \n",
            "Controlling gray markets is of strategic importance because they are often a result of a channel member failing to comply with price maintained policies. If a manufactures products appear in a gray market, said manufacture likely has unknown issues within their supply chain/channel structure that they need to fix or they will lose profits, shrink their market size, and really hurt their brand in the long run. Gray markets are common in the sale of designer goods. For example, there are multiple eCommerce sites that provide luxury goods for less than retail price because they buy the items in a country where they cost less and sell them for less than retail price in a country like the US. This not only hurts the sales of the manufactures, but also hurts the sales of their channel partners and might hurt their relationships as a result. If too many Fendi bags get sold on a gray market site, then stores like Nordstrom might not carry the product anymore and Fendi will lose a lot of revenue as a result. \n",
            "A. Coordinated and efficient pricing centers around the idea of a channel manger balancing coordinated pricing throughout the channel and efficient go-to-market strategies in an effort to maximize profit. Depending on the power a channel manger has, coordinated pricing might no be profitable or possible. Additionally, the most efficient entry into market is direct entry but this requires efficient channel technologies. The channel manager usually can’t have an ideal world,  the goal for success become trying to balance coordination and efficiency when creating pricing channel strategies.   B. Ownership transfer can create pricing challenges because when a distributor buys inventory from a manufacturer they are often able to price said inventory however they want when they re-sell said inventory. This can cause issues for manufactures and end-consumers do not often know that distributors are making pricing decision and manufactures can get a lot of flack. A good example of this is in the automotive industry. When a manufacturer like ford sells their cars, they are selling them to the dealing at a set price. But car dealerships want to make money and often sell these cars at a high price, especially when there is a high demand. Despite the dealerships choosing to sell the cars are terribly high prices, Ford is the one that is getting flack from consumers.   C. One way a company like Ford could mitigate the ownership transfer challenge is by implementing and MAP (Minimum Advertised Pricing) policy. MAPs often provide a minimum and a maximum for how much and item can be priced and are an agreed upon policy that each channel partners signs and agrees with. A MAP can provide a manufacturer like Ford a bit more control in their pricing once ownership has been transferred and helps foster better communication between channel partners. \n"

In other words, it is worthwhile to pay a channel member for the worth and value it creates through the performance of any costly but valued channel function.  B. While evaluating channel functions, the manufacturers should consider the equity principle to avoid conflicts among channel members in the future, the conflicts that can hinder the whole distribution chain from achieving the desired results and performance.  C.  A channel function analysis provides a framework that helps manufacturers understand which values each member channel brings to the table at what costs. It allows manufacturers to organize the distribution chain in a more organized, efficient, and smooth way. Channel members do not overlap in functions, operate at a reasonable expense, and get rewarded appropriately.\n",
            "Following a push strategy in channel promotion, manufacturers must develop mutual effort and cooperation in developing and implementing promotional strategies. They have to work directly with channel members to develop strong and viable promotional support that will support sales of their product/service. The most important thing in pursuing this strategy is getting channel members' buy-in. Otherwise, it will be a source of internal conflict: sales and marketing.\n",
            "A. This is a horizontal conflict case between new retailers and existing dealers. It's a domain conflict where the existing network doesn't buy into the decision to introduce new retailers in their areas.  B. To handle this case, the manufacturer must conduct channel analysis to ensure each channel member brings unique value to the distribution chain and that their role and values do not overlap. On the other hand, as the existing dealers concern about price competition and sales loss, the manufacturer must have an appropriate price control policy to prevent channel members from undercutting others, good SKUs management and allocation, and clearly explain to dealers how introducing new retailers will benefit them rather than hurting their sales and profit.\n",
            "The gray market is where customers can buy authorized branded products through unauthorized channels. As the manufacturers do not control or establish an official relationship with those unauthorized channels, it doesn't have ownership of pricing and services provided by those channels. It's vital for a brand to provide consistent shopping and product experience across channels. Otherwise, it can cause damage to brand image and hence, sales and profits.   An example is Nike stopping selling officially on Amazon. Some unauthorized sellers were selling Nike products on Amazon, and Nike was afraid that this would negatively impact its brand. Without partnership with Amazon, Nike can protect its brand image from being damaged by inconsistent customer experience provided by unauthorized sellers on Amazon. In the short term, customers buying via the Nike website may not experience smooth delivery as buying on Amazon. But data showed that Nike customers considered this tradeoff acceptable. To Nike, Amazon is just another channel to sell, not a major one. Stopping selling on Amazon doesn't impact Nike. \n",
            "A. A coordinated price means the price is attractive to end-users and profitable while incentivizing channel partners/members to perform the desired functions and behaviors. An efficient price means the price can equitably cover the cost of offering the purchasing “bundle:” product + desired channel benefits while ensuring compensating channel members for what values they contribute.  B. Ownership transfer can create pricing problems because, in this case, distributors are the ones who dictate the end-user price, and this can cause a price war among channel members if each sets its own prices, eroding profit from the distribution chain. For example, in the LDFL India case, LDFL allowed C&C to set their promotion programs, causing a conflict between the GT and C&C channels as C&C could sell at a lower price than GT.  C. Establishing Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) policy can mitigate the ownership transfer challenge. The manufacturer defines price limits which channel members may not resell their products. The price holds equally for all resellers and includes a penalty for non-compliance.\n"

This strategy includes a hard sell - slotting fees, promotional allowances, in-store or online promotions, etc. - and soft sell -  training programs, quotas, trade shows - strategies. Push strategies help convince a customer (retailer) that your product deserves to be on the shelf or should be given more shelf space.

Losing control over your distribution is going to harm your entire channel system and maybe even your company as a whole. \n",
            "This means that the brand/channel manager needs to understand the source of divergence, using incentives and managing markups. Ownership transfer gives the distributor control over pricing because the distributor now OWNS the product, therefore they can price it however they see fit. Say you want to become an Amazon seller so you buy a bunch of the same product from one company as a distributor. You can then turn around and either sell those products for a high-markup or heavily discount the price of an item that the manufacturer sees as 'exclusive' or 'expensive.' One approach could be selling on consignment - making to order what the distributor sells. This means, the manufacturer can set and control the price of their product because the distributor will first have to sell the product at a certain price in order to be able to buy it from the manufacturer thereby decreasing the amount of price gouging or increasing they can do.\n"

            "A: The equity principle is trying to achieve a win-win situation for both sides manufacturers and channel partners. So, each party should fulfill their obligations and responsibilities, more than that, working together to achieve their common goals. It also means that both parties must own a fair share of the benefits from the partnership regarding profits, increased market share, or other tangible or intangible benefits.  B: This is because it is crucial to build a strong and long-lasting relationship with channel partners. To be more specific, the equality principle can improve strategic channel performance, reduce conflicts among different parties, and enhance customer experiences. When manufacturers and their channel partners establish a mutually beneficial relationship, they can work together better to achieve common goals, which ultimately, results in higher sales, increased profits, and improved customer satisfaction.  C: The channel functional analysis framework is a systematic approach for evaluating the various functions that are performed by a manufacturer and their channel partners in the distribution of a product or service. This framework helps different parties to achieve greater equity in the channels through by improving the common understanding of the roles and responsibilities and optimized distribution channel for mutual benefit.\n",
            "Manufacturers typically use push strategies to build demand for their products within the distribution channel and encourage channel partners to actively promote and sell their products to end customers. Firstly, push strategies allow manufacturers to own more control over the distribution channel and their products, especially effective for new brands that may not have an established customer base. For example, a fishing rod manufacturer wants to expand their new brand into the market, so they use a push strategy to promote their products to retail stores and distributors. And they offer a discount code, place sample rods in retailer stores to test the market first, or implement sales incentive programs to motivate retailer owners to sell their products. Over time, as the products and brand gain broader recognition and a loyal customer base, the manufacturer may shift to a more balanced mix of push and pull strategies to maintain and expand their market share.\n",
            "A: This is a vertical conflict. It occurs between different levels of the same distribution channel. It arises from a difference in goals and interests between the manufacturer and dealers. In this scenario, the conflict is between the manufacturer and its existing dealer network. The manufacturer wants to add new retail partners to increase product distribution, but its existing dealers want to maintain more exclusivity to control market share, they are concerned that new coming retail partners would lead to price competition, resulting in lower margins and market share.  B: Minimizing conflict and improving alignment with its dealers is the primary thing to do. So, letting distributors be involved in the decision-making process is a good way to release the tough relationship. Moreover, the manufacturer could communicate with its dealers to understand their concerns and their standard to the potential retail partners. Additionally, the manufacturer could work with its dealers to develop joint marketing and promotional activities to achieve a win-win situation between both parties. By involving its dealers in the decision-making process and fostering better relations, the manufacturer can minimize conflict and build stronger relationships with its dealer network while still expanding distribution.\n",
            "Controlling gray markets is important for some manufacturers because it would harm profit margins, and their brand image and hurt the manufacturer's relationship with its authorized distributors. Customers are more likely to associate gray market products with lower quality or even counterfeit products, which leads to undermining the brand's reputation and decreased customer loyalty. When products are sold outside of official or authorized areas, the manufacturer may lose control over pricing and distribution, so, it would result in some potential channel risks and conflicts.  A good example here is Rolex watches. Rolex has a highly exclusive distribution network, and the company strictly controls the supply chains and distribution channels of its products to maintain prices. However, unauthorized Rolex watches emerged in the gray market in recent years at a lower price, this has resulted in a dilution of the brand's exclusivity and a reduction in the perceived value of Rolex watches, ultimately impacting the company's reputation and profitability.\n",
            "A: “Coordinated and efficient pricing through the channel” means that a brand needs to have a clear pricing strategy in place that fits into the different channels. This involves setting prices that are consistent with the value of the product and the customer's perception of that value, while also being competitive in the market. To achieve this, the brand needs to consider these key points, like production costs, target market, channel margins, competitors’ pricing, and strategic planning. They also need to gain an deep understanding on their target customer's needs and preferences, and what the sales point is of their products. In addition, the brand must maintain a good relationship with channel partners to ensure that pricing is consistent across all channels and that there are no pricing discrepancies that may lead to channel conflict.  B: Ownership transfer of products from manufacturers to distributors will bring pricing challenges for manufacturers, especially when the products are sold in different markets with different prices. Under this circumstance, the manufacturer may lose control over the pricing of their products, and the distributors may use their pricing power to sell the products at lower prices in some markets, in that the price divergence emerged and eroded the profit margins. Furthermore, ownership transfer may also create challenges in terms of managing inventory and sales volumes, this is because the manufacturer cannot get the first-hand of distributor’s inventory and sales performance of them, which hurts the manufacturer's production planning and forecasting. Consistent pricing and sales performance across channels guarantee an effective pricing strategy and inventory management. For example, if a manufacturer sells a product to a distributor for $100. The distributor then sells this one to a retail store for $120, earning a profit of $20. And then, the retail store sells the product to the end consumer for $150, making a $30 profit. Right now, assume the manufacturer decides to lower the price of the product to $90, however, the distributor and retailer store is still expecting to make the same profit margins, so the distributor may reject to accept the price declines and refuse to buy as much product like before from that manufacturer.  C: One approach is considering taking pricing policy in different stages of the distribution process. The manager could corporate with the distributors to reach an agreement on a pricing structure that considers the costs associated with ownership or storing costs, as well as the expected profit margin for the distributor. This provides a fair market to customers regarding the final price. Additionally, the manager also can consider implementing an effective system for tracking the distribution of their products to ensure the product are sold through the authorized channels at the right prices.\n"

This may involve negotiating pricing agreements with distributors and retailers, monitoring market prices, and implementing pricing policies to ensure consistency across all channels.  B. The transfer of ownership of a product from the manufacturer to the distributor can create pricing challenges for the manufacturer as it can lead to price divergence across channels. This is because distributors often have the freedom to set their own prices based on market demand and competition.   C. The brand/channel manager can work closely with the distributor to develop a pricing strategy that meets the manufacturer's objectives. This may involve providing incentives for distributors to maintain pricing consistency or offering promotions that encourage distributors to sell at the manufacturer's suggested retail price.\n"
